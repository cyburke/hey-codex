# Pinned below v1.13.4 on purpose: that release bundles ONNX Runtime 1.27.0,
# which has an Apple Silicon SME convolution bug that makes KeywordSpotter
# detect nothing, silently (no error, no crash - it just never fires).
# Reproduced locally against the model's own test files and reported upstream
# as k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx#3791; fixed in ORT 1.27.1. Do not bump this pin until a
# sherpa-onnx release ships ORT >= 1.27.1 - check the release's bundled ORT
# version first, not just the sherpa-onnx version number.

# completion (bash reads it to EOF for the substitution). The strict test below
